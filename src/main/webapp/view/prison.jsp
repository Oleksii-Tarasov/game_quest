<p>
    You open your eyes, ${nickname}, and discover that you are in an old dirty prison.<br>
    You do not remember why you are here.
</p>
<p>
    The air is full of dampness and death.<br>
    You are struggling to breathe and have nowhere to run.<br>
    There is a huge lock hanging on the rusty doors of your cell.
</p>
<p>
    Suddenly, a shadow is sweeping behind the door, and the lock falls to the floor.
</p>
    Now only you decide - to fight for your life and <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/location/?title=mainhall">
    get out of cell.</a>
</p>
<p>
    Or submit to fate and <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/location/?title=cage"> stay in cell forever</a>.
    <br>
</p>
    After all, the outside can be worse than here.
